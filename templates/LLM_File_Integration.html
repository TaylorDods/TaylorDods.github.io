    <h2>Large Language Model Interface with Local Files</h2>
    <p>
      The project, currently under development, is a desktop application designed to facilitate the storage, organization, and searching of local files in a highly efficient and intuitive manner. These files could be of various formats, including text, image, word, excel, and more, making it a versatile tool for both personal and professional use.

      The core functionality is centered around uploading these local files to a MongoDB database, where they are stored alongside a vector embedding of their content. This hybrid approach leverages large language models to enable interaction with the stored files, marking a significant leap from conventional data storage methods.
      
      As for the current state of the project, significant progress has been made on the backend, with data upload, navigation, and sorting capabilities successfully implemented. The immediate focus is on developing the vector store to serve as the foundation for search functionality.
      
      The envisaged outcomes are twofold.
      
      For personal users, the application promises a safe, efficient database system that reduces file space usage and acts as an advanced organizational tool.
      
      For business users, the application could serve as a powerful tool for data searching and organization. Further customization could be incorporated based on the specific field of business. For instance, companies involved in HVAC could benefit from an agent trained for CAD and REVIT, enabling them to use existing projects to inform and streamline the drafting process in new projects.
      
      Ultimately, the project seeks to harness the rapid advancement in language models to deliver a multifunctional desktop application that enhances data organization and retrieval while opening up a multitude of potential functionalities down the line.

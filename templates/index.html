        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate, I am passionate about using my diverse skillset and experience to solve real-world problems. This e-portfolio showcases my qualifications and highlights the key skills and experiences that make me a valuable asset in the engineering field.</p>

        <p>My technical expertise includes proficiency in computer-aided design tools, such as AutoCAD and REVIT, which I utilized during my internship as a Junior Engineer at Remedy Engineering. I have also gained practical experience with SolidWorks and ANSYS for designing and analyzing automotive chassis, as demonstrated in my involvement with the Shell Eco-marathon Chassis Design project.</p>
    
        <p>Through various projects, I have honed my skills in time and resource management, cross-functional collaboration, and interpreting client feedback. My participation in the Building Better Together project allowed me to integrate various needs and perspectives within a multidisciplinary team and deliver effective solutions on time and under budget.</p>
    
        <p>My academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in programming languages, such as MATLAB and Python, for statistical analysis techniques and data visualization. In addition, I have gained valuable knowledge in financial analysis and business strategies through my Business Fundamentals class, further broadening my skillset.</p>
    
        <p>With experience in modeling, analysis, and control of dynamic systems, I have developed an understanding of classical and modern control system design techniques, as showcased in my Automatic Controls class.</p>
    
        <p>Please take a moment to explore my qualifications and projects, illustrating my wide range of skills and experiences in mechanical engineering, and demonstrating my dedication to making a meaningful impact in the field.</p>
